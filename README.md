# Phase-3-week-3-code-challenge
# RESTAURANT WITH SQLALCHEMY

For this assignment, we'll be working with a restaurant review domain.

We have three models: `Restaurant`, `Review`, and `Customer`.

 

For our purposes, a `Restaurant` has many `Review`s, a `Customer` has many

`Review`s, and a `Review` belongs to a `Restaurant` and to a `Customer`.

`Restaurant` - `Customer` is a many to many relationship.

 

**Note**: You should draw your domain on paper or on a whiteboard _before you

start coding_. Remember to identify a single source of truth for your data.
